# DualTF-FLsim
### Please make sure you have gone through all the comments in the default.yaml, then statt on the experiment.
-------
### Note:
- Experiment configuration is in the /configs/default.yaml
- I also push the raw datasets, but not sure if you can pull them
- Use "python3 run_simulation.py" to run
- Use "python3 evaluation_fl_cpu.py" to gain metrics (need to wait a moment)
- All datasets should be able to run, please try a fair enough hyper-parameter
